Basic Starter theme - HTML5

This basic starter theme is an html5 version of my original basic starter theme. 
(https://github.com/crondeau/BLM-Basic-WordPress-theme)
It's exactly the same as the original but html5 ready.

--------------------------------------------------------

THIS THEME IS TO BE USED FOR BUILDING CUSTOM THEMES ONLY.

Just like the original version, this theme is devoid of design elements and so won't look that great out of the box.
It's also missing some recommended features which would be needed if you wanted to release a theme in the WordPress repository.

For example - my theme does not have comments on pages. I've never coded a site that needs them and so just don't have them in there.
I also don't have the code required doe custom background and colours. I'd rather have control of the design, thank you very much.
The theme doesn't have attachment or links templates... Again, I've never had a need for those.

If you want to create a simple custom theme, this might be the theme for you.
So check it out.
